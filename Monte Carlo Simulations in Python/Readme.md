Course Description:

This course introduces Monte Carlo simulations and their use cases. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate a range of outcomes for uncertain events, and the course will leverage on Python libraries including SciPy and NumPy for performing simulations, as well as Seaborn for communicating simulation findings.
